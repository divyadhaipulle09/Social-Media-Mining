1623317076264816641 2023-02-08 08:45:25 -0500 <LewisNFT_> Google will combine external feedback with its internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses meet a high level of quality, safety, and accuracy.,,,,,,,,,,,
1623257008852934657 2023-02-08 04:46:44 -0500 <AlanPeery> @google Bard's scientific accuracy needs serious improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1623083816586706953 2023-02-07 17:18:31 -0500 <ValVrj> @aleyda Following. It's really interesting to see the accuracy between Edge and Bard,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1623061359469502464 2023-02-07 15:49:17 -0500 <novascotiah> Love the accuracy to the book of the dwarves and bilbo sitting on their asses while Bard the Bowman does all the work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1623024512097783814 2023-02-07 13:22:52 -0500 <Evidence_Driven> @mattturck I like how ‚ÄúBard‚Äù manages expectations for accuracy. Like, you fully expect it to make stuff up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622986732366086144 2023-02-07 10:52:45 -0500 <SujalJethwani> 7. Google Bard is still in the testing phase, but it's going to be available to the public soon.   Based on the comparison, it seems like Google Bard has an edge in terms of the breadth and accuracy of the information it can provide.,,,,,,,,,,,
1622941411036303361 2023-02-07 07:52:39 -0500 <vlathia> @cgarciae88 Soon we will have a speed tests &amp; accuracy matrix between ChatGPT &amp; Bard ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622921684616445953 2023-02-07 06:34:16 -0500 <PavloSharhan> Google is testing potential ChatGPT competitors including 'Apprentice Bard' and other AI chatbot platforms. They need to fix their search engine first, as money plays a factor in the accuracy of results. #AI #Google #ChatGPT #Tech #Robotics,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622920609742131206 2023-02-07 06:30:00 -0500 <PavloSharhan> Google unveils #Bard, its answer to #ChatGPT. It's more defensive than riding hype&amp;countering a huge adversary, but concerns about accuracy remain. Sources need to be tied to plausibility for it to be useful. Bing's integration was leaked &amp; sources are included in each response.,,,,,,,,,,,
1622842877595512832 2023-02-07 01:21:07 -0500 <Dan_Barak> In what way will Bard be better than ChatGPT?  My guess: 1. Up to date information 2. Can answer a wider range of questions (e.g. math) 3. Better uptime 4. Overall better accuracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622791335781756929 2023-02-06 21:56:19 -0500 <livingin900> @BlakeMillardCFA @GRDecter I would say they have a larger eco-system to expose Bard to off bat.  Also to consider, ChatGPT uses Google's Lamda in its programming already, so to think Google is techn. behind would be a mistake. They've had the technology in place already, were just concerned about accuracy,,,,,,,,,,
1622728532601307139 2023-02-06 17:46:45 -0500 <NateSaienni> Not saying Reddit is the source of truth, but how can we evaluate quality of answers or accuracy if Bard doesn‚Äôt cite sources. Feels ick.  This could be me personally, as I‚Äôve never liked taking one answer as gospel. Have always preferred multiple takes.   Hence my Reddit usage.,,,,,,,,,,,
1622714690664284160 2023-02-06 16:51:45 -0500 <jsoltero> Much of the attention around ChatGPT/Bard/etc seems focused on the natural language response and its accuracy (or lack of it). Doesn't seem to be a lot of discussion about people's willingness to type natural language sentences into these things after years of typing keywords.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1622712711384629255 2023-02-06 16:43:53 -0500 <DrNickA> Here we go, Google‚Äôs announcement.   It‚Äôs a chatGPT competitor ‚ÄòBard‚Äô. Under the hood this is LaMDA, which is an AI specifically designed for dialogue.   It prioritises accuracy over GPT‚Äôs just bullshit approach, with a view to it being a search assistant.,,,,,,,,,,
1622710165685383168 2023-02-06 16:33:46 -0500 <Belal_M_Amin> 9/10: Google's new experiment, Bard, is a step towards creating a conversational AI that provides users with information from the web, and synthesizes insights for complex questions. The company is monitoring conversations to maintain quality, safety, and accuracy in responses.,,,,,,,,
1622704981122899971 2023-02-06 16:13:10 -0500 <web3_ready> But CEO Jeff Dean assures us that Google is taking rigorous measures to ensure the quality, safety, and real-world accuracy of Bard's responses.,,,,,,,,,,,
1622684033141575680 2023-02-06 14:49:56 -0500 <memorablezonkey> Just tested Google‚Äôs new AI offering, Bard. Not sure on accuracy of the information but I have +3 to strength for my next turn and a bonus d4 on my next crit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1621560190750412801 2023-02-03 12:24:11 -0500 <teycitek> Apprentice Bard's answers can include recent events, a feature that #ChatGPT does not yet offer. Furthermore, it has been noted that the accuracy of its responses has improved in recent weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,
